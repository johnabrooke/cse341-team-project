6. If you could change this assignment to be more effective or helpful, what would you change?
    It would be nice to have some references/reminders on how the express router and getting the post to go

    pieces needed for a refresher.

   4 - Meets requirements

8. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.
